International Migration,"International migration measures long-term arrivals and departures to and from New Zealand. This is an outcomes-based measure of migration estimated from the actual travel histories of people travelling in and out of New Zealand.
  Before November 2018, Stats NZ classified travellers based on the intentions they stated on their passenger cards when they crossed the border. Calculating the actual travel duration (outcomes-based measure) is a more accurate way of measuring migration than relying on passenger card intentions. The outcomes-based measure is available back to January 2000.
  With the removal of the departure cards in November 2018, Stats NZ made methodological changes to producing the official measures of migration, tourism, and the estimates of population.
